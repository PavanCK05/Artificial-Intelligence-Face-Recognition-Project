# Artificial-Intelligence-Face-Recognition-Project
## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements **AI & Machine Learning based Face Recognition**.  
It demonstrates how facial features can be detected and recognized using Python, OpenCV, and Machine Learning models.

The project includes both the **source code** and a **PDF project report**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Face recognition with Machine Learning
- Real-time camera input support
- Trained on sample datasets
- Project documentation in PDF format

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn / TensorFlow (based on implementation)
- Jupyter Notebook

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI_Face_Recognition_Project.git
   cd AI_Face_Recognition_Project
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate    # On Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the project:
   ```bash
   python src/main_code.py
   ```

---

## 📖 Usage
- Run the notebook `Ai_Project.ipynb` to explore the step-by-step implementation.  
- Use the Python script inside `src/` for direct execution.  
- The project will detect and recognize faces from the input source (camera or dataset).
